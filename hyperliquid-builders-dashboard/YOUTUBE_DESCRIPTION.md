```
🧵 Hyperliquid Builder Codes are creating millionaire developers.

Here's what you need to know about this $10M opportunity 👇

1/ What are builder codes?

They let developers earn fees on trades routed through their apps.

Unlike CEXs that keep everything, Hyperliquid shares revenue with front-end builders.

2/ The numbers are wild:

• $9.5M+ total revenue generated
• Top builder has earned $7.2M+
• 22+ active builders competing
• ~1/3 of HL volume from third-party apps

3/ How it works:

→ User approves your builder code
→ You submit orders on their behalf
→ When orders fill, you earn up to 0.1% on perps
→ Claim fees through the referral system

4/ Why this matters:

Traditional DEX model: Build for free, protocol takes all fees

Hyperliquid model: Developers are incentivized partners

This creates a competitive marketplace of trading interfaces.

5/ The future looks even bigger.

HIP-3 will let builders create custom markets:
• Stocks
• Prediction markets
• Commodities
• Yield-bearing collateral

Create the market AND capture the fees.

6/ We built a dashboard to track it all in real-time.

Uses gRPC streaming from Hyperliquid L1 to show:
• Live builder revenue
• Trading volume
• User counts
• Rankings

## LinkedIn Post

```
Hyperliquid is pioneering a new model in DeFi: developer revenue sharing.

Their "builder codes" system has already paid out $9.5M+ to third-party developers who build trading interfaces on top of the protocol.

Key insights:
→ Top builder has earned $7.2M in fees
→ ~33% of trading volume now comes from third-party apps
→ Developers can earn up to 0.1% on perpetual trades

This flips the traditional DEX model on its head. Instead of protocols capturing all value, they're incentivizing a competitive ecosystem of front-ends.

With HIP-3 coming (allowing custom market creation), this opportunity is set to expand significantly.

I built a real-time dashboard to track builder revenue using gRPC streaming - full tutorial in my latest video.
